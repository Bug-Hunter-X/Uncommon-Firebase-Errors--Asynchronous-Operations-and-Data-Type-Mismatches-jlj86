This repository demonstrates two uncommon Firebase errors: issues stemming from improper handling of asynchronous operations and data type mismatches within the Firebase SDK.  The `bug.js` file showcases code that incorrectly handles asynchronous operations, while `bugSolution.js` presents the corrected code implementing proper promise handling. Similarly, other examples of data type mismatches are also shown and how to solve them using proper type checking.
