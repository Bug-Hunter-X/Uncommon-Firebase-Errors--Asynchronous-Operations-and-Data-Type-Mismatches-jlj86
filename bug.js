The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you attempt to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has fully loaded.  This can happen if you use asynchronous operations incorrectly or if you don't properly handle the promise returned by Firebase functions. For example, if you immediately try to access data from a snapshot within an asynchronous function before the `.get()` method has completed, you'll encounter an error. Another error is data type mismatch where a function expects a specific type of data (e.g., a string), but it receives a different type (e.g., a number). The Firebase SDK may not always provide explicit error messages in such cases.
